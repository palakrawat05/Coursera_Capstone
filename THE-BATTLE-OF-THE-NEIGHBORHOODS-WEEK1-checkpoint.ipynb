Assume that preferably we would like the new restaurant to be located in a neighborhood with a high degree of the same ethnic characteristics, i.e. assume the languages spoken in that neighborhood, so to make advantage of the cultural element of the area. In order to sustain the new business, there should be a lot of population and the less number of competitors possible.\n",
